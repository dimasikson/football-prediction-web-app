storage:
    - [DONE] test if app can query from blob fast enough (otherwise need SQL db?)
    - [DONE] a "table" will be a folder partitioned by league and season
    - [DONE] can have common functions to read / write to the table
    - [DONE] tables needed:
        - [DONE] results
        - [DONE] fixtures
        - [DONE] processed (input for modelling)
        - [DONE] predictions

backend:
    - [DONE] refactor pipeline to update data (results and fixtures)
    - [DONE] refactor pipeline to pre-process data
    - [DONE] create training notebook
    - [] have logic for selecting the current season
    - [] automate re-training every once in a while
    - [] schedule pipeline via logic apps / web-jobs (static model)

frontend:
    - [] explore streamlit as frontend
    - [] restructure the JS code (find some proper guide like pep8 but for frontend)
    - [] the large JSON should not be loaded as global variable, instead every page refresh should query the data
    - [] the interface is too narrow on desktop (have adjustable screen size depending on the device)

mlops:
    - [DONE] explore hyperopt
    - [] monitoring
    - [] drift detection
    - [] what else?
